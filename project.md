3. **Improves Focus** — Helps redirect attention when distracted.
4. **Enhances Empathy** — Understanding own feelings helps understand others'.
5. **Promotes Open-Mindedness** — Avoids premature conclusions.

**Example:** In a meeting, a self-aware employee receiving criticism recognizes their defensiveness, sets aside emotions, listens carefully, and responds constructively — instead of misinterpreting feedback as a personal attack.

### Q.2) Write a note on active listening. What is meant by active listening?

### Q.3) What is "Readiness of Meaning"?

**Answer:**

**Readiness of Meaning** refers to the listener's/reader's preparedness to interpret and understand the intended message. It depends on the mental state, prior knowledge, expectations, and context the receiver brings to communication.

**Key Aspects:**

1. **Prior Knowledge** — Existing knowledge affects ability to understand new messages.
2. **Context** — Setting and situation shape how meaning is interpreted; same words can mean different things in different contexts.
